This game is a sliding puzzle where players drag and drop or "slide" the puzzle images to a blank grid to complete the full image.
Each turn counts up as players make a move, and players won't be able to move blocks to other blocks that are not adjacent to the current block in which player is moving.

<h2> How to Get Started </h2>
Simply drag & drop the mouse to any adjacent location until you complete the puzzle.
